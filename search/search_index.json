The setter is a unique position, where the ball is received and perfectly delivered to different positions above the net at varying heights, speeds, and arcs, all with minimal to no spin.</p> <p>There are serving machines that start at $5000, and a one-of-a-kind blocking robot that the Japan national team uses, but nothing out there for training hitting. The idea is not to build a ball launcher (this would be nowhere near the same function), but a robot that could mimic the advanced, high-speed, high-level brain of an experienced setter, all in a compact, satisfying, and less expensive solution. This means tackling the problem of a 3-dimensional set, achieving accurate horizontal and vertical position, and delivering the ball with the correct tempo (velocity). The end goal is to give the robot a specific point and type of set, and then watch it continuously send it to the exact same position each time.</p>"},{"location":"logs/week-01/#mvp-requirements","title":"MVP Requirements:","text":"<ul> <li>set ball with little/no spin</li> <li>stationary base</li> <li>different positions above net</li> <li>different tempos</li> <li>different arcs</li> </ul>"},{"location":"logs/week-01/#additional-scope","title":"Additional Scope","text":"<ul> <li>vision system for automatic set on hitter approach</li> <li>robot moves around court to practice \"out-of-system\" attacks</li> <li>rapid fire for multiple hitters</li> <li>reach out to varsity volleyball teams/organizations</li> </ul>"},{"location":"logs/week-01/#individual-updates","title":"Individual Updates","text":"<p>No individual updates for this week.</p>"},{"location":"logs/week-02/","title":"Week 02 \u2014 Sept 14-20, 2025","text":""},{"location":"logs/week-02/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Based on volleyball knowledge, training insight, and captured gameplay, the criteria, constraints, and objectives were finalized as a group.</p> <p>Began to discuss implementation methods, specifically launching mechanisms, that would target the functional requirements defined.

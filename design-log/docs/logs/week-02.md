# Week 02 — Sept 14-20, 2025

## Overview 
Based on volleyball knowledge, training insight, and captured gameplay, the criteria, constraints, and objectives were finalized as a group.

Began to discuss implementation methods, specifically launching mechanisms, that would target the functional requirements defined. The initial calculations targeted no spin and full court coverage. 

### Needs Statement:
Elite volleyball players need a cost-effective, robotic setter that reliably replicates the precision, tempo, arc, and positional variation of a top-tier human setter, filling a critical gap left by current training equipment.

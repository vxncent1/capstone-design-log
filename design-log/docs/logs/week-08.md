## Overview 

Extensive focus on ME CAD for pinball and linear actuator launching mechanism prototypes. Reuse exisiting motors, motor drivers, and microcontroller for PoC while waiting for optimized components.

## Individual Updates

### **Austin**

* Started to adapt stepper and serveo motor controller code to specific apllications
    * Looked into migrating code to different microcontroller and SBC platforms

### **Grace**

* Designed proof-of-concept (POC) prototype 'pinball' launcher mechanism, with decoupled 'cradle' and 'flipper' features
* Conducted preliminary motor sizing calculations to validate reusing existing motors for POC 'pinball' launcher
* Sourced various hardware and components for POC 'pinball' launcher

### **Kevin**

* Designed proof of concept prototype for linear actuator launcher mechanism
* Sourced and ordered components and started building prototype
* Conducted preliminary calculations

### **Vincent**

* Compared several motor options for different launching mechanisms
    * Provide initial motor driver recommendations for servos and BLDCs
    * Found initial motors and drivers for each topology
* Discussed design considerations of carriage for linear and pinball launching mechanisms
